# TaskTracker - Spring Core (XML Configuration)

This is a basic Spring Core project created to understand **types of beans** and **dependency injection** using `beans.xml`.

The project includes:
- A `Task` class representing a simple task object.
- A `TaskLogger` class used to log task details.
- A `TaskService` class where the `TaskLogger` is injected to simulate business logic.
- `beans.xml` to configure Spring beans and define their scopes (`singleton` and `prototype`).

This project was made to understand the **core concepts of Spring DI using XML**, especially bean scopes and injection styles.
